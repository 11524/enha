[신스팝](%EC%8B%A0%EC%8A%A4%ED%8C%9D.md) 그룹 [펫 샵보이즈](%ED%8E%AB%20%EC%83%B5%20%EB%B3%B4%EC%9D%B4%EC%A6%88.md)가 1990년 11월 12일
발표한 싱글. 4집 앨범 Behaviour의 두 번째 [싱글](%EC%8B%B1%EA%B8%80.md)이다.

  

제목은 [스콧 피츠제럴드](%EC%8A%A4%EC%BD%A7%20%ED%94%BC%EC%B8%A0%EC%A0%9C%EB%9F%B4%EB%93%9C.md)의 연인<del>이자 썅년으로 잘 알려진</del> 젤다 피츠제럴드의 말에서 따왔다고 한다. 그녀는 따분함을 느끼기를 주로
거부했는데, 왜냐면 그녀가 따분한 인간이 아니었기 때문이다.(She refused to be bored chiefly because she
wasn't boring.)

  

싱글 발매 당시에는 UK싱글 차트에서 최고 순위 20위에 그쳤으나 이후 펫 샵 보이즈의 명곡을 꼽을 때 반드시 거론되는 곡 중 하나가
되었다. 닐 테넌트는 1993년 인터뷰에서 자신들이 썼던 최고의 곡들 중 하나로 이 곡을 거론했으며, 이 곡만을 위한 팬사이트 [10
Years of Being Boring](http://www.10yearsofbeingboring.com/)도 있다.

## 가사 ¶

I came across a cache of old photos  
And invitations to teenage parties  
"Dress in white" one said, with quotations  
From someone's wife, a famous writer  
In the nineteen-twenties  
When you're young you find inspiration  
In anyone who's ever gone  
And opened up a closing door  
She said: "We were never feeling bored  

'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end"  

When I went I left from the station  
With a haversack and some trepidation  
Someone said: "If you're not careful  
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for  
In the nineteen-seventies"  
But I sat back and looking forward  
My shoes were high and I had scored  
I'd bolted through a closing door  
I would never find myself feeling bored  

'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that, looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  

Now I sit with different faces  
In rented rooms and foreign places  
All the people I was kissing  
Some are here and some are missing  
In the nineteen-nineties  
I never dreamt that I would get to be  
The creature that I always meant to be  
But I thought in spite of dreams  
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me  

'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that, looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  

And we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"  
And we were never being boring  
We were never being bored  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We were never being bored
