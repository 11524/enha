## 1 개요 ¶

레이드는 인스턴스 던전과 비슷하지만, 더 큰 규모로 디자인되었으며, 2개 이상의 원정대가 들어가서 완수할수 있도록 설계되어있다. 이러한 인스
이내에는 주로 Arch-nemesis 급의 보스들이 자리 잡아서 복잡한 전략을 짜야만 잡을수 있도록 구성되어있다.  

## 2 레이드 잠금 ¶

Raid Locks are designed to prevent any player from completing the same stage
of an instance multiple times in a short period of time. For example, Raid
Locks prevent a single character from slaying Helchgam over and over again in
order to get his slime. Endgame Locks generally expire weekly, meaning any
character can complete a particular boss battle no more than once a week.  

  

Raids can only be entered by players who are a part of the raid group and have
either the same or "similar" raid locks as the raid leader, or no raid locks.
If a player is part of a raid that completes a stage in the instance (usually
a boss fight), then the player will receive a lock number corresponding to the
number of the stage completed. As the raid progresses, more such locks are
obtained. A few examples of how raid locks work:  

  

Raid leader has locks 1,3,5; raid member has no locks -> raid member will be
able to enter, and will inherit raid leader's locks.  
Raid leader has locks 1,6; raid member has locks 1,6 -> raid member will be
able to enter.  
Raid leader has locks 1,3,4; raid member has locks 1,4 -> raid member will be
able to enter, and will inherit raid leader's lock 3.  
Raid leader has locks 1,3,4; raid member has locks 1,3,5 -> raid member will
not be able to enter.  
Raid leader has no locks; raid member has locks 1,4 -> raid member will not be
able to enter.  
To find out which raid locks you have, open the Social menu, then select the
Group Stage Info tab. The lock numbers your character has are listed by
instance under Personal Stage Information.
