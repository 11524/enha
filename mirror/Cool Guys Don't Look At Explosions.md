[The Lonely Island](The%20Lonely%20Island.md)의 2009년 [MTV](MTV.md) 어워드를
위해 [J.J. 에이브람스](J.J.%20%EC%97%90%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%8C%EB%9E%8C%EC%8A%A4.md)와
함께 만든 <del>병맛</del>노래이다. 한국어로 <del>굳이</del> 번역하자면 **쿨가이는 폭발을 보지 않아**.
<del>이름부터 약이다</del>

가사는 대략 이렇다.

> Seems like these days the whole world's on fire  
Things keep blowing the hell up  
And while all those rubber neckers and lucky louies stand and slackjaw's
staring  
The real men have the nuts to walk away  
Yeah  
Cool guys don't look at explosions  
They blow things up and then walk away  
Who's got time to watch an explosion  
Cause cool guy's errand's that they have to walk too  
Keep walking, keep shining  
Don't look back, keep on walking  
Keep struttin', slow motion  
The more you ignore it, the cooler you look  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Please join me in welcoming, Mr. Neil Diamonds  
Ha ha ha, where are we  
Cool guys don't look at explosions  
They stride forward in their diamond covered boots  
They wear jumpsuits with glitter and rhinestones  
And walk away in slow motion..  
Keep walkin, you're cruisin..  
Cherry Cherry...Sweet Caroline..  
Denzel walks...  
Will Smith walks...  
Mark Wahlberg is wearin a hat!  
Keyboard solo, JJ Abrams!  
Yeah!  
Now you're talkin'  
Woohoo!  
Okay  
Because, Cool guys don't look at explosions  
The flames are hot but their heart is chilled  
Walk fast from the boring explosion  
And don't think about the people you've killed  
Two, three four!  
Aaaaaaaahh.....

<del>[무슨 약하시길래 이런 뮤비를 만들었어요?](%EB%AC%B4%EC%8A%A8%20%EB%A7%88%EC%95%BD%ED%95%98%EC%8B%9C%EA%B8%B8%EB%9E%98%20%EC%9D%B4%EB%9F%B0%EC%83%9D%EA%B0%81%EC%9D%84%20%ED%96%88%EC%96%B4%EC%9A%94.md)?</del>

보다시피 약의 완전체이다(...). <del>물론 [The Lonely Island](The%20Lonely%20Island.md)라는
그룹 자체도 약을 한트럭했지</del>  
그런데 그것이 최근에는 뭔가 [폭발](%ED%8F%AD%EB%B0%9C.md)이 일어나는 상황에 대입하는 경우가 많다.
