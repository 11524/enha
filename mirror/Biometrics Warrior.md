  * [아케이드](%EC%95%84%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C.md) 수록 : 미수록
  * 가정용판 수록 : [15 DJ TROOPERS](%EB%B9%84%ED%8A%B8%EB%A7%A4%EB%8B%88%EC%95%84%20IIDX%2015%20DJ%20TROOPERS.md)
  * 단위인정 수록 : **10단** (CS 15 DJ TROOPERS)  

가정용 15 DJ TROOPERS에 수록된 [GUHROOVY](GUHROOVY.md)의 [브레이크 코어](%ED%95%98%EB%93%9C%EC%BD%94%EC%96%B4%20%ED%85%8C%ED%81%AC%EB%85%B8#s-3.8.md)의 일종인 레게코어 넘버.
215의 빠른 BPM과 동시치기, 16박의 폭타와 계단 등으로 상당한 체력곡으로 가정용 군투덱의 단위인정 10단에 올라와있다.  
난이도가 어느 정도 있는 12렙 곡임에도 불구하고 CS DJ TROOPERS에만 수록되어 있는 것 때문에 곡의 인지도는 낮은 편이다.

## 가사 ¶

{{|(Listen!)  
A long, long time ago, We were the one, we were the one.  
color of skin, color of hair, color of eyes and color of life.  
It was not possible to understand each other.  
There is a person who suffers at this time now.

  

The time of the hundred million  
how many year is exceeded  
Let's become once again now.  
again, again, again,  
& again & again, now!

  

* Everybody JUMP!   
Let's get it on!  
Clap your hands!  
and shake your body!

  

Take a look around.  
We are united.

  

This is an important thing.

  

Everybody JUMP!  
Let's kick it now!  
Clap your hands!  
and shake your body!

  

Take a look around.  
We are united.

  

I gotta dance.

  

beat the keyboard according to the rhythm.  
beat the drum pad according to the rhythm.  
be scratch turntable according to the rhythm.  
preform dance steps according to the.., again!  
Beat the keyboard according to the rhythm.  
Beat the guitar according to the rhythm.  
be scratch turntable according to the rhythm.  
perform dance steps according to the rhythm.  
The world sings.  
The world plays it.  
Enough in the game if you fight  
When not getting enjoyment out of hardcore life

  

* Refrain

  

Everybody jump! (jump jump jump)  
Clap your hands! (hands hands hands)  
Take a look around. We are united.  
This is war! This is war!

  

Let's make all arms a controller.  
It ties wherever you are.  
It is a friend and it is a rival.  
Let's become one by this tune.|}}
