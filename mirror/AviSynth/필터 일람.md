ChromaShift

This filter will shift the chrominance information by an even number of
pixels, in either horizontal direction. It can also apply an overall vertical
shift of the total chrominance information, up or down. It is primarily
intended to correct improper colour registration.

ChromaShiftSP

This script can shift chroma in all directions with subpixel accuracy.

ColorMatrix

ColorMatrix corrects the colors of MPEG-2 streams. More correctly, many MPEG-2
streams use slightly different coefficients (called Rec.709) for storing the
color information than AviSynth's color conversion routines or the XviD/DivX
decoders (called Rec.601) do, with the result that DivX/XviD clips or MPEG-2
clips encoded by TMPGEnc/QuEnc are displayed with slighty off colors. This can
be checked by opening the MPEG-2 stream directly in VDubMod.

ReInterpolate411

This is a fast simple filter to correct the improper 4:1:1 => 4:2:2 conversion
that seems to occur with some DV/4:1:1 codes when used with Avisynth. It
assumes the odd chroma pixels are duplicates and discards them replacing them
with the average of the two horizontally adjacent even chroma pixels. It
doesn't matter whether the clip is interlaced though it must be in YUY2 format
for Avisynth 2.5. There are no parameters, and currently no readme file.

DOCI

Destruction of Chroma Interlacing fixes a problem where you captured
pulleddown video in YV12. In the combed frames, the chroma from two frames has
been blended, leading to a ghosting effect when IVTC'd. This filter
reconstructs the chroma exactly and fixes the problem.

FDecimate

The FDecimate() filter provides extended decimation capabilities not available
from Decimate(). It can remove frames from a clip to achieve the desired frame
rate, while retaining audio/video synchronization. It preferentially removes
duplicate frames where possible. ("FDecimate" stands for "Free Decimate",
which implies that the output frame rate may be freely chosen, and is not
limited to 1-in-N decimation).

GreedyHMA

GreedyHMA is an Avisynth filter that executes DScaler's Greedy/HM algorithm
code to perform pulldown matching, filtering, and video deinterlace. It has
pretty much been superseded by Donald Graft's DeComb package. However there
may be occasions where it sometimes gives preferable results, especially with
some bad PAL clips.
